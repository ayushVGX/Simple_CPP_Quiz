# Simple CPP Quiz

Hey Fellows,

This C++ Program is very simple but yet based on modern C++. I have used a ```questions.csv``` file to read questions from the file, resulting one could add his questions accordingly.

### Some Guides :

To add questions, Simply first open ```questions.csv``` in any basic text editor (even Notepad) and leave the first line empty.
Followed by the questions and its four options and the correct answer.

__Suppose this to be your text editor :__

```csv
        **LEAVE FIRST LINE EMPTY**
question,answer1,answer2,answer3,answer4,correct_answer         // Add Questions here line by line as many you want
question,answer1,answer2,answer3,answer4,correct_answer
 ...
 ...
```
