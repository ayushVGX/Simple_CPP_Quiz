# Simple_CPP_Quiz

Hey Fellows,

This C++ Program is very simple but yet based on modern C++. I had used a "questions.csv" file to read questions from the file, resulting one could add his questions accordingly.

Some Guides : 
To add questions, Simply first open "questions.csv" in any basic text editor ( even Notepad) and leave the first line empty.
Followed by the questions and its four options and the correct answer.

Suppose This to be your text editor -
>**_________________________________________________________
|   /* LEAVE FIRST LINE EMPTY */
|question,answer1,answer2,answer3,answer4,correct_answer                     // Add Questions here line by line as many you want
|question,answer1,answer2,answer3,answer4,correct_answer
| ...
